## [Privacy Friendly Sudoku v1.0](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-sudoku/releases/tag/v1.0) - 22 Mar 2016

Privacy Friendly Sudoku is an Android application for playing the Sudoku logic puzzle. It belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps and thus is optimized regarding a user's privacy. It does not include any permission and completely relinquishes advertisement and tracking mechanisms. 

Privacy Friendly Sudoku has three different game modes:
1. a 6x6 game field with 2x3 subsections
2. a 9x9 game field with 3x3 subsections
3. a 12x12 game field with 3x4 subsections

For each game mode there are three different difficulty levels, that are not measured by the number of preset values but rather by the solving strategies needed to solve the game. The generator always tries to provide a game that has the minimum amount of preset values, that are needed to solve the game.

A level generator checks for the above mentioned strategies. If the generator has to take a guess, the level is automatically classified as hard. A human player has many more strategies available, with which these puzzles are solvable as well. 

A maximum of ten games can be saved and continued at any time.

A list with the best times is available, that saves the best times for each game mode and difficulty.
Furthermore there is a help function, that will reveal the selected field. If this help function is used the current game will not be included in the highscore list.
